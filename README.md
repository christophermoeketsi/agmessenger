*******************Comments on the application ***********************

Assumptions that were made when making the application .
The application is not persistent - and therefore has not concept of history or state at
this given point in time .

Improvements that I wanted to make to the application
    Introduce a graph database
    Use a file watcher to pickup and load files
    Introduce multitheading to load the messages and the users (This is why I used a hashtable to store the cached users)
    Finally use websockets to, push and pull messages

*******************Installing and packaging the application ***********************
1) cd rootofapplication/common-all
2) mvn package -DskipTests;

you should get a target folder
3) cd target

java -jar original-common-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -u path_to_follower_file -m path_to_message_file


             ----------------------------------OR ----------------------------------------


There is a bin folder in the root

java -jar original-common-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -u path_to_follower_file -m path_to_message_file
