Assumptions that were made when making the application .
The application is not persistent - and therefore has not concept of history or state at
this given point in time .

Improvements that I wanted to make to the application
    Introduce a graph database
    Use a file watcher to pickup and load files
    Introduce multitheading to load the messages and the users (This is why I used a hashtable to store the cached users)
    Finally use websockets to, push and pull messages
